<h1> Web scraping pythpn script </h1>

<h2> Intro </h2>
This script will scrape the website: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions <br>
and print the highest value on the console while also writing it down in a log file. <br>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
Obviously you need Python to be able to run this script, so I'm assuming that you've already have it up and running. <br>
If you don't, you can simply install python with the help of a youtube tutorial. Keep in mind that we're using Python 3.8. <br>
I do reccomend to use the latest version of Python. <br>
You need to install pandas and bs4 if you haven't done so already, otherwise the script won't run. <br>
<ul>
  <li> pip install pandas </li>
  <li> pip install bs4 </li>
</ul>
 <br>
You can do so simply by using the pip install command in the terminal of your operating system. <br>

<h2> Usage </h2>
If you are on a Ubuntu OS you can use the command git clone to download this repository. <br>
<ul>
  <li> git clone https://github.com/AyoubVD/database_advanvced.git </li>
</ul>
<br>
You need to run this script on python, it will keep running until you press ctrl + c. <br>

<h2> Use of this script </h2>
This script scrapes the website mentoined above, and returns the highest value each minute whilst putting it in a log file.
